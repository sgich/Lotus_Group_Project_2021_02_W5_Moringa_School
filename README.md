## __E-commerce - French Customer to Customer (C2C) fashion store__ ##


## _Description_ ##
The growth of E-commerce over the recent years, due to technology and recent occurrences such as the Global pandemic, has brought with it new opportunities in business.
One such new business opportunity that e-commerce has enabled is the C2C business — also called an online marketplace. This business structure connects consumers to exchange goods and services through an online platform. The owners of the online platform typically make their money by charging transaction or listing fees. Online businesses like Craigslist and eBay pioneered this model in the early days of the internet with the most recognizable being Amazon.
 
C2C businesses benefit from self-propelled growth by motivated buyers and sellers, but face a key challenge in quality control. When it comes to C2C stores, since they are both the supplier and buyers it is even more vital to uncover meaningful insights.

E-commerce requires ways of  evaluating gaps in service delivery. Users being the key pillar in this business, means that a great focus should be placed on them to improve user experience. Given data from a successful French fashion C2C online store, analysis was carried out to derive useful insights from it.
